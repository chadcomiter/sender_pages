Aside from snow, information is a necessity for skiers and snowboarders. With the growing popularity of the multi-resort passes, this need for information has become more pressing for the resort-goer. Navigating unfamiliar resorts is not only a matter of guest satisfaction but also of safety. Although it is possible to find applicable resort-specific issues via current apps, these apps are unintuitive, frustrating, and clunky. We seek to centralize resort information, such as conditions, trail/lift status, and weather, to help streamline the resort experience.

Our app would target two types of users: resort guests and resort staff. Guests want to feel safe and relaxed so they can better enjoy their trips to the mountains. They do not want to be surprised with ice, avalanche conditions, and other incelement weather. Guests should be able to use this information to plan what trails they will ski during their visits. While important for the average guest, weather and terrain conditions are crucial for those that frequent advanced terrain and the backcountry.

Resort staff could leverage the app for marketing and promotional purposes, but also for the safety of employees. Ski patrol would hypothetically be able to add location-specific warnings, such as "Exposed Rocks" or "Ice/Hard-packed conditions," in a Waze-style manner.

Our intended implementation includes a central dashboard where a user can add resorts to a watchlist. Each resort would have its own profile, which would ideally be maintained by the resort itself. Users will be able to navigate to each resort profile where more granular information will be displayed. We intend to interact with a simple weather API (something like https://openweathermap.org/api, pending a more robust solution) and more specific ski resort map/trail-related APIs (https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) to pull information regarding trails and areas.





Our project is attempting to centralize information regarding ski mountains, conditions, trail availability, and weather in a single place to help inform a user. Most ski resort apps are outdated, difficult to use, and unreliable. Our two main demographics of users would fall into customers and resort-related staff, namely ski patrol. Customers want to ensure that their trips are safe and fun, and that they aren't going to be surprised with ice, avalanche conditions, or other incelement weather. While for the average resort-goer, this is a nice value add,weather and conditions can have very serious implications for the dedicated back-country downhiller. Additionally, users will want to know what is open and where before they get to their destination. 

Resort staff would also be interested in this app, not just for marketing and promotional reasons, but for safety as well. Ski Patrol would hypothetically be able to add specific warnings regarding their area of jurisdiction, such as "Exposed Rocks" or "Ice/Hard Packed". In our ideal implementation, there would be "waze" style badges indicating potential risks in a given area.

We intend to implement a central dashboard where a user can add ski areas to a watchlist. These would ideally be maintained by the resort or area itself, but users would also be able to interact with the "ski area cards". The card itself would display information regarding the weather and conditions of a given area. Clicking on the card will bring the user to an expanded view with more granular information. We intend to interact both with a simple weather API (something like https://openweathermap.org/api, pending a more robust solution) and more specific ski resort map/trail related APIs (https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) to pull information regarding trails and areas.
