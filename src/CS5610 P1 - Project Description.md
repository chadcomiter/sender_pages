Aside from snow, information is a necessity for skiers and snowboarders. With the growing popularity of the multi-resort passes, this need for information has become more pressing for the resort-goer. Navigating unfamiliar resorts is not only a matter of guest satisfaction but also of safety. Although it is possible to find applicable resort-specific issues via current apps, these apps are unintuitive, frustrating, and clunky. We seek to centralize resort information, such as conditions, trail/lift status, and weather, to help streamline the resort experience.

Our app would target two types of users: resort guests and resort staff. Guests want to feel safe and relaxed so they can better enjoy their trips to the mountains. They do not want to be surprised with ice, avalanche conditions, and other incelement weather. Guests should be able to use this information to plan what trails they will ski during their visits. While important for the average guest, weather and terrain conditions are crucial for those that frequent advanced terrain and the backcountry.

Resort staff could leverage the app for marketing and promotional purposes, but also for the safety of employees. Ski patrol would hypothetically be able to add location-specific warnings, such as "Exposed Rocks" or "Ice/Hard-packed conditions," in a Waze-style manner.

Our intended implementation includes a central dashboard where a user can add resorts to a watchlist. Each resort would have its own profile, which would ideally be maintained by the resort itself. Users will be able to navigate to each resort profile where more granular information will be displayed. We intend to interact with a simple weather API (something like https://openweathermap.org/api, pending a more robust solution) and more specific ski resort map/trail-related APIs (https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) to pull information regarding trails and areas.
