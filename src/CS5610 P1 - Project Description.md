Our project is attempting to centralize information regarding ski mountains, conditions, trail availability, and weather in a single place to help inform a user. Most ski resort apps are outdated, difficult to use, and unreliable. Our two main demographics of users would fall into customers and resort-related staff, namely ski patrol. Customers want to ensure that their trips are safe and fun, and that they aren't going to be surprised with ice, avalanche conditions, or other incelement weather. While for the average resort-goer, this is a nice value add,weather and conditions can have very serious implications for the dedicated back-country downhiller. Additionally, users will want to know what is open and where before they get to their destination. 

Resort staff would also be interested in this app, not just for marketing and promotional reasons, but for safety as well. Ski Patrol would hypothetically be able to add specific warnings regarding their area of jurisdiction, such as "Exposed Rocks" or "Ice/Hard Packed". In our ideal implementation, there would be "waze" style badges indicating potential risks in a given area.

We intend to implement a central dashboard where a user can add ski areas to a watchlist. These would ideally be maintained by the resort or area itself, but users would also be able to interact with the "ski area cards". The card itself would display information regarding the weather and conditions of a given area. Clicking on the card will bring the user to an expanded view with more granular information. We intend to interact both with a simple weather API (something like https://openweathermap.org/api, pending a more robust solution) and more specific ski resort map/trail related APIs (https://skimap.org/pages/Developers) to pull information regarding trails and areas.
